Place your Android APK here so the "Get Free Android App" link works.

1. Build the APK in Android Studio (Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s)).
2. Copy the built APK (e.g. app-debug.apk from Android_App/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/) to this folder.
3. Rename it to: FK-Learning-Hub.apk

The homepage link points to: apk/FK-Learning-Hub.apk

For more options (e.g. GitHub Releases), see APK_DOWNLOAD_SETUP.md in the Website folder.
